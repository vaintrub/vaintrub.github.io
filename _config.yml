  My name is George. I am a 2nd year student at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute.

  **What do I hope to accomplish in the nearest future?**

  I love to participate in non-standard and unique projects. Most of all I am interested in studying highload solutions, their optimization and development. I am planning to dive into the study of the *Lua* language, and I also want to gain experience in *C/C++* development.

  **English level:** <mark>B2 Upper-Intermediate.</mark> My goal is to successfully pass the FCE exam

  Despite my course, I am confident that I can devote <mark>30 hours</mark> a week to a job.

          While studying at Mephi, I've learned to manage my time wisely; At that time I should have combined technoatom courses and specialized classes, as well as English classes and I studied all the subjects equally well. Thanks to distance learning, I acquired the skills of independent study.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
