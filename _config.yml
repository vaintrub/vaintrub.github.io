  **What do I hope to accomplish in the near future?**

  Most of all I am attracted by the study of highload solutions, their optimization or development. In the near future I plan to dive into the study of the *Lua* language, and I also want to gain experience in *C/C++* development.

  **English level:** B2 Upper-Intermediate

  My goal is to successfully pass the FCE exam

  I can devote <mark>30</mark> hours a week to the job.

          During my time at Mephi, I've learned to manage my time wisely. Based on the experience of the last semester, when I combined technoatom courses and specialized classes, as well as English classes without prejudice to anything. It should be noted that distance learning taught self-education more strongly.
